# Understanding multitenancy

[Suggest Edits](/edit/multitenancy)## Overview


This document describes concepts related to multitenancy in Pinecone indexes. This includes information on different approaches to keeping sets of vectors separate within a Pinecone index. To learn how to create or modify an index, see [Manage indexes](manage-indexes).


You may need to segment vectors by customer or otherwise either physically or logically. This document describes different techniques to accomplish this and the advantages and advantages of each approach. 


## Namespaces


One approach to multitenancy is to use <namespaces> to isolate segments of vectors within a single index. This is a 'pool' model that shares most resources between tenants while keeping them logically separate.


### Advantages


* Namespaces reduce the need for additional indexes, reducing maintenance effort.


### Disadvantages


* Customer data is not isolated in its own pod. This means tenants share compute and storage resources.
* Deleting tenant data is more complicated and takes more time.


## Metadata filtering


This approach to multitenancy stores all segments of vectors in a single index and [filters by metadata](metadata-filtering) at query time. This is another 'pool' model; here, you separate tenants on the query level.


### Advantages


* Metadata filtering allows you to query across multiple tenants.
* Metadata filtering reduces the need for additional indexes, reducing maintenance effort.


### Disadvantages


* Customer data is not isolated in its own pod. This means tenants share compute and storage resources.
* There is no way to track tenant-specific costs.
* You cannot provision tenants with different dimensions or pod type characteristics, which are set at the index level.


## Separate indexes


Another approach to multitenancy is to create a separate index for each segment. This is a 'silo' model that provides dedicated resources to each tenant. For example, if you need to separate vectors for each customer, you can create a separate index for each customer.


### Advantages


* This model separates tenants into different pods, preventing queries across tenants and allocating compute and storage resources to each tenant.


### Disadvantages


* Creating and maintaining multiple indexes requires additional effort and cost.
* Because this model doesn't share resources between tenants, you must assign each tenant at minimum one [pod](indexes#overview). This is extremely inefficient if you have tenants with small number of vectors.
* Creating a new index takes more time than creating a namespace.
