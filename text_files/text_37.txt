[Suggest Edits](/edit/add-users-to-projects-and-organizations)## Overview


If you are a [project](/docs/projects) or [organization](/docs/organizations) owner, follow these steps to add users to organizations and projects. 


## Add users to projects and organizations


1. Access the [Pinecone Console](https://app.pinecone.io).
2. Click **Settings** in the left menu.
3. In the **Settings** view, click the **USERS** tab.
4. Click **+INVITE USER**.
5. (Organization owner only) Select an [organization role](organizations#organization-roles).
6. Select one or more projects.
7. Select a [project role](projects#project-roles).
8. Enter the user's email address.
9. Click **+INVITE USER**.


When you invite another user to join your organization or project, Pinecone sends them an email containing a link that enables them to gain access to the organization or project. If they already have a Pinecone account, they still receive an email, but they can also immediately view the project.
