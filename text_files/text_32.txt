To configure Pinecone billing through the GCP Marketplace, follow these steps:


1. Log in to the [GCP Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace). Your project must be enabled for purchase by your billing administrator.
2. Search for the [Pinecone listing](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/pinecone-public/pinecone).
3. Click **Subscribe**.
4. Read and agree to the terms and conditions.
5. Click **Subscribe**.
6. On the **Your order request has been sent to Pinecone** dialog, click **Sign up with Pinecone**.
7. On the **You're leaving Google** dialog, click **OK**. This takes you to the Pinecone sign-in page.
8. Sign in to Pinecone.io.


When you sign in, Pinecone creates a new organization linked to your GCP billing.


If you already have a Pinecone organization, you can select the new "GCP Linked" organization in the top-left drop-down menu in the console.
