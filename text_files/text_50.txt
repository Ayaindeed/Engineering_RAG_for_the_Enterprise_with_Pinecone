# Limits

[Suggest Edits](/edit/limits)This is a summary of current Pinecone limitations. For many of these, there is a workaround or we're working on increasing the limits.


## Upserts


Max vector dimensionality is 20,000.


Max size for an upsert request is 2MB. Recommended upsert limit is 100 vectors per request.


Vectors may not be visible to queries immediately after upserting. You can check if the vectors were indexed by looking at the total with `describe_index_stats()`, although this method may not work if the index has multiple replicas. Pinecone is eventually consistent.


Pinecone supports sparse vector values of sizes up to 1000 non-zero values.


## Queries


Max value for `top_k`, the number of results to return, is 10,000. Max value for `top_k` for queries with `include_metadata=True` or `include_data=True` is 1,000.


## Fetch and Delete


Max vectors per fetch or delete request is 1,000.


## Namespaces


There is no limit to the number of <namespaces> per index.


## Pod storage capacity


Each **p1** pod has enough capacity for 1M vectors with 768 dimensions.


Each **s1** pod has enough capacity for 5M vectors with 768 dimensions.


## Metadata


Max metadata size per vector is 40 KB.


Null metadata values are not supported. Instead of setting a key to hold a null value, we recommend you remove that key from the metadata payload.


Metadata with high cardinality, such as a unique value for every vector in a large index, uses more memory than expected and can cause the pods to become full.


## Retention


In general, indexes on the Starter (free) plan are archived as collections and deleted after 7 days of inactivity; for indexes created by certain open source projects such as AutoGPT, indexes are archived and deleted after 1 day of inactivity. To prevent this, you can send any API request to Pinecone and the counter will reset.
