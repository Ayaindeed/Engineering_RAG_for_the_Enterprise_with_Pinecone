# Amazon SageMaker

[Suggest Edits](/edit/sagemaker)Amazon SageMaker and Pinecone can be used together for high-performance, scalable, and reliable **R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG) use-cases. The integration allows us to use SageMaker compute and model hosting for **L**arge **L**anguage **M**odels (LLMs) and Pinecone as the *knowledge base* that allows us to keep our LLMs up to date with the latest information and reduce the likelihood of hallucinations.


Below are our example notebooks on how we can use Amazon SageMaker for RAG with Pinecone.
