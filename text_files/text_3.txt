# Architecture

[Suggest Edits](/edit/architecture)## Overview


This document describes the basic architecture of the Pinecone database.


## Basic architecture


The Pinecone vector database is a cloud-based service deployed partly on Kubernetes. Pinecone serves control plane requests from an API gateway and routes these requests to user indexes; clients make data plane requests directly to pods. See Fig. 1 below.

## Components


* **Pods**. Each index has one or more replicas, each of which is deployed to a pod with assigned SSD and memory capacity. The CPU assigned to the pod performs computation; the SSD stores metadata.
* A **stream processor** indexes vectors.
* The **blob store** contains persistent snapshots of replica data.
